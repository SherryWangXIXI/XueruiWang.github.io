abstract: In order to further expand the flight envelope of quadrotors under actuator failures, we design a nonlinear sensor-based fault-tolerant controller to stabilize a quadrotor with failure of two opposing rotors in the high-speed flight condition (> 8m/s). The incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) approach which excels in handling model uncertainties is adopted to compensate for the significant unknown aerodynamic effects. The internal dynamics of such an underactuated system have been analyzed, and subsequently stabilized by re-defining the control output. The proposed method can be generalized to control a quadrotor under single-rotor-failure and nominal conditions. For validation, flight tests have been carried out in a large-scale open jet wind tunnel. The position of a damaged quadrotor can be controlled in the presence of significant wind disturbances. A linear quadratic regulator (LQR) approach from the literature has been compared to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed nonlinear method in the windy and high-speed flight condition.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This work, for the first time, applies Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion controller on an under-actuated control system, namely a quadrotor with complete loss of two opposing rotors. A high-speed wind-tunnel flight test demonstrates the robustness of this method.
