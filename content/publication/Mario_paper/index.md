abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for aeroelastic tailoring of free-flying aircraft with composite wings. A continuous-time state-space model is used to describe the flow. The 3D composite wing structure is condensed into a Timoshenko beam model by means of a cross-sectional modeler. The aerodynamic and structural models are closely coupled with the six degrees of freedom flight dynamic equations of motion in the state-space formulation. This paper refers to the clamped-wing aeroelastic tailoring as classic aeroelastic tailoring. Hence, the term aeroelastic tailoring will point at the novel approach that includes free-flying aeroelastic phenomena into the optimization process. The emphasis of the present paper is to show the effects of aeroelastic tailoring on body-freedom flutter and flight dynamic stability at large. The results of this paper will be used in the further development of aeroelastic tailoring practices for composite aircraft design.
