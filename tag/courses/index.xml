      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an MSc profile course. This course describes and analyses the responsibility of engineers in the light of philosophical, historical and juridical backgrounds. Topics covered include 1) Description and analysis of the problems encountered by engineers who want to act responsibly; 2) Codes of ethics for engineers. 3) Argumentation and reasoning. 4) Uncertainty, ignorance, risks, and their implications for responsible behaviour. 5) (Philosophical) ethics, the foundation of (criteria) for good and bad, right and wrong, responsible and irresponsible behaviour; 6) Responsibility within and of organizations; 7) the role of law. Since 2021, I act as a tutor and essay supervisor for the course in every Q3.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AE4311 Non-linear and Adaptive Flight Control</title>
      <link>/course/ae4311/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an MSc elective course. It introduces nonlinear and adaptive control techniques to enhance the reconfigurability of aircraft flight control systems. Advanced nonlinear and adaptive control techniques such as Adaptive Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (ANDI), Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI), Adaptive Backstepping (ABS) and Incremental Backstepping are described together with applications to fault-tolerant and reconfigurable aircraft flight control system designs. I am a guest lecturer for the INDI control theory part in every Q4 since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AE4ASM522 Applied Aircraft Aeroelasticity</title>
      <link>/course/ae4asm522/</link>

      <guid>/course/ae4asm522/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course is an MSc elective as a follow-up of AE4ASM506 Fundamentals of Aeroelasticity. This course presents three more advanced topics in aeroelasticity. 1) nonlinear aeroelasticity; 2) flexible aircraft flight dynamics; 3) panel methods. Understanding the contents of this course will prepare the student for the design of future aircraft configurations. Since 2020, I am in charge of the design, teaching, and assessment of the flexible aircraft flight dynamics and a part of nonlinear aeroelasticity in every Q4.&lt;/p&gt;
