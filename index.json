Inspired by birds, the active morphing wing can adapt its shape in different flight conditions for optimizing the aerodynamic performance. Moreover, wing morphing surfaces can be used as direct lift control devices for alleviating the structural loads caused by gusts and maneuvers. Furthermore, wing morphing can execute flight control commands with reduced drag.\nThe Smart and Aeroelastic Structure research group in Delft University of Technology has designed, manufactured, and tested a seamless active morphing wing named SmartX-Alpha. It has six translation-induced camber morphing trailing edge modules, interconnected seamlessly by elastomer materials. Each one of the modules is executed by two independent servos, which allows both camber and twist morphings. The wing is made in fiberGlass weave material, and its laminate design is optimized by a fluid-structure interaction tool.\nThe SmartX-Alpha prototype won the Student Hardware Competition in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) 2020 conference on smart materials, adaptive structures and intelligent systems.

This project aims at introducing novel flight control methods to mitigate the consequence of in-flight motor failures, which rarely happens but is still a big safety threat after large scale deployment of drones in the future.\nTo be specific, the project leverages incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) control method, to stabilize and control a quadrotor with failure of a single rotor or two opposing rotors, under significant aerodynamic disturbances. These strong aerodynamic effects are dominant in high-speed flight, or windy conditions. Thanks to the robustness of the INDI controller, the damaged quadrotor maintains controllable in spite of these aeordynamic disturbances.\nWe have validated the proposed controllers in a large scale wind tunnel, named Open Jet Facility at TU Delft. Despite a complete loss of one or two propellers, the tested quadrotor can maintain high-speed flight. In addition to validating the controller, these wind tunnel flight tests have produced valuable data for identifying aerodynamic models of a quadrotor, in both nominal and damaged conditions.\nAnother focus of the research aims at recovering the damaged quadrotor after motor failure. When a motor failure is detected, a quadrotor might have been entered a detrimental flight condition, such as an upside-down orientation, where the drone can hardly recover to stable flights using the state-of-art methods. Therefore, we have developed an upset recovery controller, using a novel control allocation approach.\n","date":1597449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1597449600,"objectID":"7c64e3cfdcbc41d48612c59559a549d3","permalink":"/project/quadrotorftc/","publishdate":"2020-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/quadrotorftc/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, we design fault-tolerant control algorithms for quadrotors with complete loss of one or more rotors in high-speed flights.","tags":["Quadrotor Fault Tolerant Control"],"title":"Quadrotor Fault Tolerant Control","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sihao Sun","Xuerui Wang","Qiping Chu","Coen de Visser"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This increase is beneficial for the aerodynamic performance of the aircraft. Moreover, to reduce the airframe weight, composite materials are widely used in modern aircraft. For example, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner aircraft uses 80% composite by volume, and 50% composite by weight. Although composite materials provide the same load-carrying capacity with less structural weight, the resulting structural rigidity also decreases. With the coaction of high aspect-ratio and wide usage of composite materials, modern commercial aircraft are becoming more and more flexible.\nThis trend leads to considerable interactions among aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and flight dynamics. If not harnessed properly, the interactions can lead to severe structural vibrations and even instabilities.

We proposed a new sensor-based incremental control framework for generic multi-input and multi-output nonlinear systems with an arbitrary relative degree. The closed-loop stability in the presence of model uncertainties and external disturbances are proved using Lyapunov methods. The robustness of the system to regular and singular perturbations are also analyzed.\nFor mitigating the chattering effect in the sliding mode control (SMC), many adaptation mechanisms have been proposed to reduce the switching gains. However, less attention is paid to the control structure, which influences the resulting uncertainty term and determines the minimum possible gains. Our research compares three control structures for inducing higher-order sliding modes in finite time: nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) based SMC, higher-order sliding mode control (HOSMC) with artificially increased relative degree, and the recently proposed incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) based SMC.\nWe also define the controllability margin (CM) and observability margin (OM) from the view of singular perturbation and regular perturbation.
