      <title>AE4ASM522  Applied Aircraft Aeroelasticity (2020/21 Q4)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course is a follow-up of AE4ASM506 Fundamentals of Aeroelasticity. This course presents three more advanced topics in aeroelasticity. 1) nonlinear aeroelasticity; 2) flexible aircraft flight dynamics; 3) panel methods. Understanding the contents of this course will prepare the student for the design of future aircraft configurations. I am in charge of the design, teaching, and assessment of the flexible aircraft flight dynamics and a part of nonlinear aeroelasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AE4311 Non-linear and Adaptive Flight Control (2020/21 Q4)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This course introduces nonlinear and adaptive control techniques to enhance reconfigurabilities of aircraft flight control systems. Advanced nonlinear and adaptive control techniques such as Adaptive Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (ANDI), Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI), Adaptive Backstepping (ABS) and Incremental Backstepping are described together with applications to fault tolerant and reconfigurable aircraft flight control system designs. I gave a guest lecture on the theoretical improvements of the NDI control method. The applications of INDI on launch vehicle propellant slosh and seamless morphing wings were also presented.&lt;/p&gt;
